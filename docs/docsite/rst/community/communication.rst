Communicating
=============


Mailing List Information
------------------------

Ansible has several mailing lists.  Your first post to the mailing list will be moderated (to reduce spam), so please allow a day or less for your first post.

`Ansible Project List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project>`_ is for sharing Ansible Tips, answering questions, and general user discussion.

`Ansible Development List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_ is for learning how to develop on Ansible, asking about prospective feature design, or discussions about extending ansible or features in progress.

`Ansible Announce list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-announce>`_ is a read-only list that shares information about new releases of Ansible, and also rare infrequent event information, such as announcements about an AnsibleFest coming up, which is our official conference series.

`Ansible Container List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_ is for users and developers of the Ansible Container project.

`Ansible Lockdown List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-lockdown>`_ is for all things related to Ansible Lockdown projects, including DISA STIG automation and CIS Benchmarks.

To subscribe to a group from a non-google account, you can send an email to the subscription address requesting the subscription. For example: ansible-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com

IRC Meetings
------------

The Ansible community holds regular IRC meetings on various topics, and anyone who is interested is invited to 
participate. For more information about Ansible meetings, consult the `meeting schedule and agenda page <https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/meetings/README.md>`_.

Tower Support Questions
-----------------------

Ansible `Tower <https://ansible.com/tower>`_ is a UI, Server, and REST endpoint for Ansible, produced by Ansible, Inc.

If you have a question about Tower, visit `Red Hat support <https://access.redhat.com/products/ansible-tower-red-hat/>`_ rather than using the IRC channel or the general project mailing list.
